# Final Project (CSE 598) - MOPSO vs Off-The-Shelf MOGA

## Introduction

This is the final project for **CSE 598**, developed by **Joshua Elkins** and **Sangeet Ulhas**.  
We implemented a Python-based **Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO)** algorithm and compared it against an off-the-shelf **Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA)** from the `pymoo` optimization library.  

The goal is to evaluate the performance of these two multi-objective optimization techniques on a set of benchmark functions commonly used in the field.
